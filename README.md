# PolyDev
My personal playground for polyglot programming with different languages and frameworks

# Disclaimer
Here I test different programming concepts. In my professional career as software engineer
I have been working with Java since it came up with version 1.0.2. However, I am fascinated
by the concepts of functional programming. The past developments in Java and othe OO languages have shown that more and more functional concepts find there way into the traditional object oriented world. Whatever I provide here is not intentended for production usage. The code might
change frequently and will be stay alpha version forever. I am also very aware that there might
exist better algorithms than those I have implemented. As said I am mainly playing around here
to try how I could solve a particular problem in different languages.

# Some notes about the programming languages
## Java
Java is mainly a classic object-oriented programming language inspired by C++. When Java
came up its main features why it became successful where garbage collection, platform
independent object code (develop locally and run it anywhere) and the ability to run in
web browsers (applets). One of the main critism on Java have always been performance concerns.
Interestingly, those arguments have changed: Platform independence have become almost unimportant with Linux and Docker as prevalent target platforms. Almost all modern languages
provide sophisticated memory management. Finally the Java applet technology is dead, no one
uses Java in a web browser, it has been completely replaced with technologies like
Typscript/Angular. Performance has become less important with powerful backend systems and
highly scalable service oriented architectures.
For me the main argument for using Java now is the vast amount of (freely) available, mature
and stable framework and software components.

## F#
F# is mainly a functional programming language derived from the ML family.


# How to use this playground online
The easiest way to play on my playground is to register with gitpot.io
and open my repository with the link below in the browser based IDE Gitpod.

https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/qrider71/PolyDev

The IDE accesses a remote docker container which is set up for software
development is several programming languages. There are no further installations
required on your local system, the remote system provides all required dependencies.
All you need is a normal web browser.

## How to build the software
From the Gitpod IDE open a terminal. From The PolyDev directory simply execeute
the build script: ./build.sh

## How to run the software
From the Gitpod IDE open a terminal. From The PolyDev directory simply execeute
the build script: ./run.sh

# How to use this playground on your local system
The source code should be independent from your local system. However, the provided
shell scripts will only work on Unix like systems and MacOS X. To build and run the
software you need to set up the development environments for the programming languages
used in this project. The best way is to have a look in the provided Docker file.
